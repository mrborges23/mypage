## PoMo-cod: a polymorphism-aware phylogenetic codon model

A major goal in evolutionary biology is to understand the forces that operate in the genomic sequences and are responsible for the adaptation of species to different environments. Codon models are one of the main tools used to infer selection on protein-coding genes. These have been popularized in comparative genomic studies by their extensive use in genome-wide scans of diversifying selection. However, models of codon evolution have significant limitations that are increasingly being recognized. The main one being that current codon models make simplistic assumptions about the evolutionary process. This project offers a new polymorphism-aware model, PoMo-cod, to detect signatures of natural selection acting on protein-coding sequences. PoMo-cod will address codon evolution in a unique way by properly reconciling the neutral and adaptive population-level processes by which coding sequences evolve. More importantly, PoMo-cod will allow us to tell apart the sole action of natural selection from known confounding forces (e.g., fluctuating demography and GC-biased gene conversion), ultimately producing more accurate genome-wide maps of diversifying evolving genes. The outcomes of this project have broader and impactful implications for other fields. A deeper understanding of the adaptive process would help mitigate anthropogenic action on biodiversity and develop species-specific conservation strategies. Moreover, the selection maps help characterize the genome functionally, thus being directly relevant to medical research.
