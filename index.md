## About me

<img src="https://i1.rgstatic.net/ii/profile.image/591035822534666-1517925329445_Q512/Rui_Borges4.jpg" height="250">

I am a junior group leader at the Institute of Population Genetics (VetMedUni Vienna). I am fascinated by the evolution of genomic sequences. I develop models of sequence evolution that aim at reconciling the population- and species-level processes by which species continuously emerge and diverge. My research also includes developing computational and statistical methods to detect molecular signatures of evolutionary relevance from large-scale genomic datasets, now commonplace in molecular studies.

Interests:
* Population genetics
* Phylogenetics
* Bayesian inference
* Bioinformatics
