I am an Evolutionary Biologist working at the Kosiol lab (VetMedUni Vienna) on developing models and species tree inference methods. More specifically, I work with polymorphism-aware phylogenetic models (PoMos). PoMos can be viewed as an extension of classical nucleotide substitution models, which additionally consider polymorphisms. During the last years, I have been extending these models to account for natural selection. More recently, I have also been interested in developing methods to infer selection in experimental evolution data.

Interests:
* Population genetics
* Phylogenetics
* Bayesian inference
* Bioinformatics
