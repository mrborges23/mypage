## Assignment 4
## Testing the molecular clock hypothesis

In this assignment, you will be determining whether your sequences follow the molecular clock hypothesis. 
You should use the Bayesian phylogenetic tree obtained in the assignment 2; you can delete the branch lengths by opening this tree in Seaview and saving it as a cladogram.

For the global clock, add a calibration point at 6.4 mya for the human-chimp node; or 8.6 mya for the human-gorilla node if your alignment lacks chimp.

1. Use amino acid sequences for this task, and do not forget to use an appropriate empirical amino acid model. By an appropriate model, I do not mean to perform a hierarchical LRT; all I need is a biological justification for the amino acid model used.

2. Explain your strategy to obtain a rooted and unrooted version of your Bayesian tree. Provide these trees in Newick format in the answer sheet.

3. Determine the age of the great apes emergence and the amino acid substitution rate per million years under the global clock hypothesis.

4. Considering the results of the LRT test, can this marker (i.e., your gene) be used to molecular dating analyses? Justify your answer.

Some notes:
* Partial grading will be given to answers that, despite being incorrect, show a good understanding of phylogenetic concepts and technical procedures. Thus, do not forget to justify all your answers and show the steps leading you to the final solution.
* Do not submit any output files that you will obtain by running the required software. Instead, validate your answers by summarizing the information contained in these files in the form of tables or plots. Translating complex information into sentences, tables, or plots is an important skill that will be evaluated in your answers.
* Every assignment should be appropriately identified using the following name: `RB_AssignmentNumber_YourStudentNumber`. Upload each assignment as an independent PDF file into my vetcloud (link sent by email).
