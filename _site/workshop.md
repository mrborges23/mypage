## Workshop

The meeting includes a workshop entitled **New approaches and methods to phylogeny inference** that will run alongside the talks. The workshop consists of three sessions of two hours and will focus on the polymorphism-aware phylogeny estimation, including practical exercises based on the software IQ-TREE and RevBayes.

The workshop is free, but the number of participants is limited. Students and researchers are invited to apply by submitting a motivation letter. Preference will be given to participants that are currently performing phylogenomic analysis in real data.
